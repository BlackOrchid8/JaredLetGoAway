# JaredLetGoAway

Jared Leto's wacky antics since he became The Joker have just been too much. Everyday we see something about this 'lunatic' and 'wacky method actor' and with Jared playing The Joker in all future DCEU incarnations he won't be going anywhere soon, so why not nicely filter him out of your browser. 

JaredLetGoAway does exactly that, a fork of Trump Filter created by Rob Spectre and Kardashian Filter created by bgjj04, it will work similar to them two with some differences mostly making Jared Leto go away. 

JaredLetGoAway will detect instances of Leto on a webpage and block them and will come with sensitivity settings that allow the user to customize how aggressive they want the filter to be.
