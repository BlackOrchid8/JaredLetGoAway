# JaredLetGoAway

Jared Leto's wacky antics since he became The Joker have just been too much. Everyday we see something about this 'lunatic' and 'wacky method actor' and with Jared playing The Joker in all future DCEU incarnations he won't be going anywhere soon, so why not nicely filter him out of your browser. 

JaredLetGoAway does exactly that, a fork of Trump Filter created by Rob Spectre, it will work similar to Trump-Filter with some differences mostly making Jared Leto go away.
